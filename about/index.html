        <p>
        Have you ever noticed, you think about some product and right it’s front of you on the internet... Ever thought how the internet knows so much about you? As we all know privacy is a myth, Our chats, calls, contacts, SMS everything is being tracked by internet companies to use us as a product, They sell this data to show us personalized ads, They tell us nothing is being tracked, Our applications are end to end encrypted, We never store anything, But we the ‘Users’ know the truth. Being early developers, our team felt, Can we do something about it?

<br>

With this we came out with an idea called “ENCHATT” – Keep your personal conversations safe and secure, In Enchatt we can assure something to all our users and that is privacy, Since Enchatt is a privacy-centric site, We never store or either track you in any way including your name, The users are completely anonymous here, No registrations required, Just create a server, share the link and you are good to go!!! , We believe privacy is every man’s right, We the developers of Enchatt have tried our best to provide you with a secure chatting experience all over the world...
<br>
Our initial release will be done on 15th Aug 2021, We will be looking forward to improving it in the upcoming days, Thank you for the support.
<br>
Do mail us for improvements or bug fixes, We would definetly look towards it.
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
Team Enchatt
